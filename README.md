# OATH-TOTP App

- Store TOTP account credentials in an sqlcipher'd database
- Generate TOTP Codes
- Generate QR Codes to add your accounts to multiple devices

This was born from an awful experience with *Google Authenticator* where I
realised I could not export or backup my codes. Not wanting to move from F/OSS
GA to the closed source Authy app, I wrote a simple piece of software to
securely store my OATH-TOTP private keys, and generate codes on demand at the
command line, which will let me add the accounts to whatever MFA devices I
want, e.g. all of my handsets.

&lt;rant&gt;
Yes this goes against the whole point of "something you have", but "something
you have" isn't very useful if you're overseas and someone's nicked your
handheld device. If you still have, say, a tablet with you back in your
hotel... then you're not permanently and irrevocably locked out of accounts
that don't use a "backup code" method like Google, and you're not stuck with
Google's arrogant assumption that "We use backup codes, so everyone does", or
their other assumption that you'd move your Google Authenticator app across
their servers, to another device with GAPPS
&lt;/rant&gt;

# N.B.

- I'm still learning this language, the code is probably rubbish
- Yes, the database password is taken in plaintext from the CLI, that could
  probably be improved a LOT
- No HOTP support

# Installation

```console
$ go install github.com/erasche/go-otp
```

# Usage

Currently all commands must be run in the same directory each and every time.
This is bad, I am aware. Future versions will improve upon this.

## Initialize the database

```console
$ go-otp init -password your_space_free_password
```

(If someone wants to PR the password stuff, I would be VERY thankful)

## Register New Services

```console
$ go-otp add -password $password -secretKey LONGSECRETKEY -account alice@local.host -issuer AWS
```

## Overwrite Existing Service Entries

```console
$ go-otp add -password $password -secretKey LONGSECRETKEY -account alice@local.host -issuer AWS -update
```

## Generate Codes

```console
$ go-otp gen -password $password -account alice@local.host -issuer AWS
[Valid for 16s] 123456
[Valid for 30s] 111111
[Valid for 30s] 222222
```

## List Registered Services

```console
$ go-otp list -password $password
Services:

    AWS : alice@local.host
    AWS : jane@university.edu
    DigitalOcean : alice@gmail.com
    GitHub : alice@gmail.com
    ...
```

## Generate QR Codes

```console
$ go-otp qr -password $password
QR Code stored to AWS__alice@local.host.png
QR Code stored to AWS__jane@university.edu.png
QR Code stored to DigitalOcean__alice@gmail.com.png
QR Code stored to GitHub__alice@gmail.com.png
```
